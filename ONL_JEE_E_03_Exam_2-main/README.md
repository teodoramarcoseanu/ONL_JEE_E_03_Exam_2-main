# Exam 2
> Important information

Read the following instructions before you start solving the exercises and tasks.

## How to get started?

1. Create a [*fork*](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) of the repository with exercises.
2. Clone the repository to your computer. Use the `git clone repository_address` command to do this.

You can find the repository address on the repository page by clicking the "Code" button.

Make sure to use the address of your own fork, it should look like this:
`https://github.com/your-login/repository_name`


3. Import the project as a `Maven` project, according to the instructions below:

	* In `IntelliJ` select: `File –> New –> Project from Existing Sources...`
	* Point to the location of the directory with the cloned project and confirm.
	* Then, in a new window choose: `Import project from external model` and indicate `Maven`
	* Select ` Finish`, (in `IntelliJ` before 2020: `Next –> Next –> Next –> Finish`);

4. Solve the exercises and tasks and commit the changes to your repository. Use the commands `git add file_name`.
If you want to add all changed files at once use `git add .` 
Remember that the dot at the end is important!
Then commit the changes with the command `git commit -m "description of changes"`
5. Push the changes to your GitHub repository.  Use the command `git push origin master` to do this.
For repositories created after October 1, 2020 `git push origin main`.
6. Create a [*pull request*](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) to the original repository when you have completed all exercises.
